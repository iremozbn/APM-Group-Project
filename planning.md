# Project Planning & MVP Goals

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Goals
The following features must be completed for the first release:
1.  **User Interface:** A drag-and-drop enabled Kanban board.
2.  **Task Management:** Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) tasks.
3.  **Data Persistence:** Tasks are saved in a database (Tasks do not disappear on refresh).

## Milestones
- **Week 1:** Setup & Basic API (Backend), HTML Structure (Frontend).
- **Week 2:** Connecting Frontend to Backend (API Integration).
- **Week 3:** Testing, Bug Fixes & Final Report.

## Branching Strategy
- Do not push directly to `main`.
- Create a feature branch for every task:
  - Example: `feature/login-page` or `fix/api-error`.
